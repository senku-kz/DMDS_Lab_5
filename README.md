# DMDS_Lab_5

## Data Understanding
- description for all the features (dependent and independent)
- Data visulaization between the target/dependent feature and indendent features

## Interpretability using interpretable model (for Numeric Dataset)
- Interpretability using a linear/logistic regression
- Interpretability using tree-based model(s) (e.g., DT, RF or GBT etc)
- Specific at least three important features in terms of priority and quantity (e.g., magnitude) in one linear/logistic regression, in terms of the weight and the effec
- Specific at least three important features in terms of priority and quantity (e.g., percentage) in two tree-based models
- Important features comparison, analyses, and selection for the highest quantity, with
high visualization

## Interpretability in terms of SOC
- Calculate the SOC for all the compared estimators in terms of SOC. And, visualize in terms of SOC and Error/Accuracy; optinally other methods.

## Readability and Communication
- Can the presentation slides be readable easily, and presented clearly?

## Time Management
- 5 min presentation only to the instructor, covering all the important parts
